# Phase 1 Mini Project

This repo will be used for Tuesday and Wednesday's morning exercises. The night before, a notebook will be pushed to the `notebooks` folder of this repo, and a message will be sent in the slack channel notifying you. 

This week's lecture material focuses on data querying and data collection techniques. We will use the skills learned from the previous to create a customized dataset that can answer specific and interesting questions.
